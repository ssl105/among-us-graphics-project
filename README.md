# Among Us Graphics Project
This is my opengl project for my graphics course in Fall 2020 that revolves around the game
Among Us. The program renders the lobby in its original texture along with the astronauts 
shaded using cel shading (toon shading). The lobby holds 10 astronauts; 9 non-playable characters (NPC)
and 1 user controlled characters. The NPCs move and stop at random intervals. They also spawn and 
despawn at random intervals, leaving behind a unique particle animation that matches the
astronauts color. The program also features collision detection using bounding spheres so that
the astronauts do not pass through each other.
